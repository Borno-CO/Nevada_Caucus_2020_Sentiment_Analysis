# Nevada_Caucus_2020_Sentiment_Analysis
## Denver University Data Analytics Boot Camp - Final Project
## Students: David Born, Sam Ewing, Pranav Jayanth

## Proposal:

This project will examine tweeter sentiment towards the candidates of the Nevada 2020 Democratic Caucus. We will be scraping Twitter in order to gather data, which will then be fed into our Machine Learning model. Once the data is processed, tweet sentiments will be displayed on an interactive website showing sentiment scoring, statistics, and a random selection of positive and negative tweets for each candidate.
